### Chapter 6 - Lighting

## Introduction

Modern homes have many lighting options, both inside and out. LED lights save electricity and some can change colors and be controlled remotely.

## Internal Lighting

## External Lighting

### Permanent Holiday Lighting

Every year I attempted to put up Christmas lights on our home. Occasionally I waited too long to put up lights and winter would set in. Once it was snowing, it became too dangerous for me to get up on the roof to hang lights. Those years we would go without Christmas lights on our house.

One year we saw an advertisement for permanent holiday lighting. We called them up, got an estimate and had them installed a few months later. Now we can highlight our home without climbing up on the roof.

#### Timers

Permanent lighting can be automated with timers. We have white highlights in the early morning hours year round and depending on the upcoming holiday, a themed set of colors in the evening.

#### Patterns

Many permanent lighting options have the option to create your own patterns and color schemes. Here are a few that I've created for our home.
