### Chapter 7 - Garage

## Introduction

The garage is where you store your stuff and in some cases park your car (if there's room). You might have a fridge or freezer there for quick unloading after a grocery trip. You might run a temporary workshop out of your garage. You might have a greenhouse with artifical lights.

## Garage Door

The garage door conceals your possessions from the neighbors. It is a movable wall that keeps the neighborhood stray cats out. It's an indicator on whether anyone is home when it's open, proudly displaying your parked cars (or missing cars when you leave but forget to shut the door). Luckily, newer garage door openers and accessories will allow you to remotely open or close the door in case you are headed out of town and forgot to close the door before driving away. I've circled the block before, not remembering whether we hit the button to close the door as we drove away.

Modern garage door openers can also alert your phone or watch when the door opens or closes. This is useful to monitor when your kids have arrived home from school.
