### Chapter 2 - Movie Lovers

## Introduction

To some, movies are a major part of their life. They have their favorite franchies, actors and genres. They've seen their favorites multiple times and can quote them verbatum. They know the release date for both theaters, disc and streaming for new films.

## Movies as Framed Art

When you sit down and watch a movie, it's typically playing at a frame rate between 24 and 60 frames per second. Your brain perceives that as physical motion. Movies are an art form that consist of both video and audio. What if you could convert your favorite movie to an art piece in your home? This is possible by slowing down the frame rate and playing it back one frame at a time.

I wouldn't recommend watching new movies this way, but for movies you and your family have seen many times, it can become a centerpiece in your living room or family room. As the movie plays back one frame at a time, you might notice details that you never knew were there. Of course you lose the audio, but if it's a movie you're familiar  Unlike framed art, the movie will eventually reach its end. For a 1 1/2 hour movie, it can take about 2 full days to play from start to end.

### Slow Playback Setup

Setting up a movie for slow playback involves a few steps.

#### Hardware

* Screen: A TV or another screen like a desktop monitor
