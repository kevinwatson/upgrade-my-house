### Chapter 5 - Cameras

## Introduction

Your phone is a convenient way to capture moments. It's always available, and because of apps and its connectivity to wifi or cellular networks, makes captured videos or photos easy to share. Your home can also be equipped with camera equipment to capture photos or videos of events either inside our outside your home. Because your home has an internet connection, your home cameras do too. They can be monitored from either inside the house or remotely while you're away.

## Doorbell Cameras

Doorbell cameras are a popular option, because they can either replace existing doorbell buttons or battery powered versions can be mounted anywhere, even on apartment doors. When a visitor "rings the bell" or pushes the button, a number of things can happen. A notification can appear on the owner's phone with a photo or a live video stream of the visitor. The microphone can also activate on the doorbell to allow the visitor to engage in a conversation.

## Surveillance Cameras

The next time you enter a restaurant or office building, look up at the ceiling. There are most likely mounted cameras capturing your every move. Some cameras are obvious with lenses and wires running into the wall, while others are hidden behind small, black domes.

Setting up surveillance cameras is also an option for your home. You can install cameras to capture events both inside and outside of your home. You can access these cameras remotely from your laptop or phone, or at home from your Amazon or Google device.
